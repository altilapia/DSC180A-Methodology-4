_Section A017_ Simulation coding exercises for teaching probability theory  
Mentor: Peter Chi 🐐  

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic covered in my domain so far has been the creation of probability exercises, but more specifically, learning how to incorporate simulation. The addition 
of simulation adds an extra layer to conventional pedagogical methods and really helps contextualize each problem.  
**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
A potential investigation I would like to pursue for my quarter 2 project is the efficacy of our simulated exercises on students of different backgrounds. For example, I would like
to explore whether prior knowledge in certain fields contributes to the success of students rather than the simulation itself. Also, I would like to see if it's possible to measure the effectiveness of our study based on the amount of time taken to complete the assessments.  
**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
A potential change I'd make to my Quarter 1 Project approach would be the way that I created my assessments. I initially started from a textbook and researched individual chapters,
attempting to figure out which topics needed to be covered for each lesson. I think something I'm interested in doing is starting with a real-world problem instead, then applying the topic's concepts in a more sequential and intuitive way.  
**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
Another technique I'd be interested in using in my project is turning my Shiny app into more of an assessment rather than an interactive graph. As of now, we have proposed the
idea of deploying Shiny apps, but have yet to determine their exact purpose and benefit in its role within the study we're conducting. I think exploring different ways to even use 
a Shiny app in this context may allow us to further supplement our simulations.
